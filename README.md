# **yapp** â€” Yet Another Python (data) Pipeline

yapp is a simple python data pipeline framework, inspired by [ploomber](https://github.com/ploomber/ploomber).

yapp allows you to quickly define pipelines to pack together your messy Python experiments and make better
use of them.

**Development is still in early stages, many things may change in the future.**

If you are looking for a similar tool to use right away in something resembling a production environment, just
use Ploomber.

yapp strives to be as simple as possible and make you focus on the correctness of your algorithms.
It's developed with specific requirements in mind and built according to those: it may be the best choice for you once completed, or may be not.
Basic functionality is there but there are some very rough edges to be smoothed. There are no tests and not even a proper example yet.



## Install

```
pip install yapp-pipelines
```



## Usage

See [documentation](https://cavenditti.github.io/yapp/).
